Technocrat is meant to be multiple programs rolled into one, with a GUI to boot. Phones have so much potential and despite running android which is Linux based, we have no access to a terminal. Even terminal emulators lack some functionality that the actual terminals have. I decided to make this app to provide a GUI for some of the more common terminal functionalities.
